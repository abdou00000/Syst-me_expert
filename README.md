This application serves as an expert system designed to assist users in troubleshooting their PC problems effectively. It provides two distinct sessions tailored for both users and experts, offering a seamless experience for problem resolution.

#Key Features:
User Session: Users can access a user-friendly interface to input their PC problems. The system utilizes a set of predefined rules stored in a rules file to analyze the issues and provide relevant solutions.

Expert Session: Experts have privileged access to the system, allowing them to add, modify, or delete rules in the rules file. This ensures that the system remains up-to-date and adaptable to evolving troubleshooting scenarios.

#Technologies Used:
JavaFX: The application's graphical user interface (GUI) is built using JavaFX, providing a rich and interactive user experience across multiple platforms.

IntelliJ IDEA: The development environment for this project is IntelliJ IDEA, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development. Its features such as code completion, refactoring tools, and version control integration have greatly facilitated the development process.

#How it Works:
User Troubleshooting: Users interact with the system through a user-friendly interface, inputting their PC problems. The system then applies predefined rules to diagnose and offer potential solutions based on the provided information.

Expert Management: Experts can log in to the system to manage the rules file. They have the ability to add new rules, modify existing ones, or remove outdated rules, ensuring that the system remains accurate and effective in addressing PC issues.

#Usage:
User Session: Users can simply launch the application and follow the prompts to input their PC problems. The system will then provide recommended solutions based on the rules file.

Expert Session: Experts need to log in with their credentials to access the expert interface. From there, they can manage rules as needed, ensuring that the system remains robust and adaptable.
